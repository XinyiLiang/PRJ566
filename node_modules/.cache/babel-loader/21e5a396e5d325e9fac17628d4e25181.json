In recent years, gambling in Saint Twins has become \n                    illegal, but because fans of the \"throw in the cards\" had to look for different\n                    places for this.</strong> (you could learn about the complicated relationship \n                    of poker with the law from an article in the newspaper, which reported that \n                    “another poker room has been set up”)</p>\n\n                    <p class=\"text-left\">That ill-fated evening, August 17, Mr. Madison, borrowing some money from \n                        his colleagues, went to a closed poker tournament, which was held at the \n                        Grand Cascade Hotel. A very motley audience gathered there, among whom was\n                        a very curious character - <strong>Balazs Adrian - a Hungarian collector who brought\n                        to St. Twins a collection of Indian antiquities and, among others, a porcelain\n                            figurine of Ganesha.</strong> (this information was also available in the newspaper)\n                            Fortune was with Madison, but the collector who drank was not. As a result, \n                            the actor won the ill-fated figurine and set off home.\n                    </p>\n\n                    <p class=\"text-left\">\n                    A receptionist followed, serving guests at the hotel that evening. \n                    This person's name is <strong>Ray Wesley. He was seduced by the possibility of quick\n                    enrichment </strong>(you can guess about his love of prosperity by talking with him -\n                    he was very obsequious about a collector who dumped money right and left, \n                    and he followed the guest in the hotel parking lot (the parking guard, if \n                    you asked, answered you that he didn’t see any of the guests, but there was \n                    no talk of employees.) By the way, the owner of an antique store gives a\n                        description of a person with Wesley’s appearance - this person wanted to \n                        sell Indian values.\n                    </p>\n\n                    <p class=\"text-left\">Having led Mr. Madison long enough, Mr. Wesley stabbed him\n                    in the head with a <strong>bar siphon</strong>. (you could find the gun at the bottom of the lake,\n                    where the attacker threw it. Of course, nobody told you about this, but there is\n                        a Poseidon diving center in the catalog, whose services you can use and find a \n                        siphon, as well as a broken bottle of whiskey “Morrisson's,” which Owen received\n                        on the forehead, we will return to this a little later).\n                    <br />\n                    <br />   \n                    Madison was seriously injured by the blow, but remained alive for some time. \n                        Weasley drove the victim to the bridge in order to simulate a car accident.\n                        <br />   \n                        <br />   \n                        Upon reaching the bridge, Wesley got out of the car and poured a lot of\n                        alcohol into Madison's mouth (that Madison didn’t get drunk on his own \n                        can be understood from the autopsy report: the coroner indicated a large\n                        amount of alcohol in his stomach, but the ppm in the blood was strikingly less.)\n                        <br />  \n                        <br />   \n                        It was at this time that <strong>Richard Owen</strong>, an ordinary hard worker returning home, \n                        rode across the bridge from the night shift. Being a kind and sympathetic person\n                        (what they tell you at Owen’s place of work - at the Twin Electro factory), Owen\n                            stopped the car, got out and asked if help was needed. <strong>Wesley grabbed a bottle</strong>,\n                            which he poured into Madison's almost lifeless body, and smashed it on the \n                            forehead of an unsuspecting man to <strong>get rid of the witness</strong>. Owen lost \n                            consciousness (it was easy to guess that the injury was caused by the bottle\n                            by reading the autopsy report, which mentions fragments of glass around the\n                            forehead - whereas the windshield of Owen’s car is intact).\n                            <br /> \n                            <br />   \n                            \n                            Wesley put both victims in cars and directed the transport in such a \n                            way that it looked like a car accident. In the penalty parking lot, you \n                            can see that one car has side damage. The cars flew down from the bridge,\n                                one at a time, according to ranger McDuff - presumably Wesley pushed them \n                                one at a time. It was impossible to see this in more detail, because, as \n                                you know, there was rain and fog.\n                            </p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n           </div>\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            </div>\n    \n    \n      </Styles>\n    )\n\nexport default Play;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
